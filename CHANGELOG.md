# Changelog

All notable changes to this package will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Removed the redundant package prefix from Runtime, Editor and Tests layer directories
  (for example, `Runtime/Core`). Namespace and assembly names and Unity GUIDs are preserved;
  source paths, test fixtures, standalone tools and current documentation follow the new layout.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-08-23

### Added - Runtime performance counters

- Added allocation-free duration and integral value counters under
  `EjoyFramework.Core.Performance`, with value-type measurement scopes and snapshots.

### Fixed

- Fixed `ProcedureComponent.Start` so Unity recognizes and resumes its coroutine in
  Editor, Player, and headless batch mode.
- Configured `DataTableComponent` during `Awake`, before the framework composition-root
  validation runs.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-08-22

### Added — Typed UI routing and binary save codecs

- Added strongly typed `ScreenRoute<TViewModel, TArguments>` and
  `DialogRoute<TViewModel, TArguments, TResult>` contracts. Routed MVVM no longer transports
  arguments or view models through `object userData`, and dialog completion uses allocation-light
  value handles instead of `Task` / `TaskCompletionSource`.
- Added deterministic UI stack synchronization for Back, modal, external close, loaded-close, and
  loading-cancel paths. `UIStack.StackEntry` is now a value snapshot and per-open callback closures
  were removed.
- Added pluggable binary `ISaveCodec` payload serialization with Newtonsoft JSON dictionary support,
  while retaining legacy ESV1 save migration compatibility.
- Added resource batch/cache handles, config blobs, generated helper factories, object tracking,
  zero-GC text helpers, and expanded architecture/performance validation tests.

### Changed — Assembly and lifecycle contracts

- Unity-dependent production assemblies now use the `.Unity` marker; engine-agnostic assemblies no
  longer reference Unity assemblies.
- UI routes are available for registration during `Awake`, while navigation is explicitly gated
  until UI groups and helpers become ready in `Start`.
- Component lookup now separates optional `TryGet` semantics from required dependency resolution.

### Changed — Core renamed to `EjoyFramework.Core`

- The core assembly + folder + root/module namespaces were renamed `EjoyFramework` →
  `EjoyFramework.Core`. Consumers now use `using EjoyFramework.Core;`. **Breaking** for any
  external code referencing the `EjoyFramework` assembly/namespace.
- The core's Unity and Editor satellites were nested under `.Core` for consistency with the
  GamePlay layer: assembly+folder+namespace `EjoyFramework.Unity` (ns `EjoyFramework.Runtime`)
  → `EjoyFramework.Core.Unity`, and `EjoyFramework.Editor` (ns `EjoyFramework.EditorTools`)
  → `EjoyFramework.Core.Unity.Editor`. The family is now uniform:
  `Core` / `Core.Unity` / `Core.Editor` ‖ `GamePlay` / `GamePlay.Unity` / `GamePlay.Editor`.
  (`UIComponentEditor` qualifies `UnityEditor.Editor` to avoid the namespace/type clash.)

### Changed — Architecture: GamePlay parity + Core↔GamePlay layering

- **Battle moved out of core.** `Skill`/`Buff`/`IBattleEntity` (Skill+Buff+DamageCalculator) moved from
  `EjoyFramework` into `EjoyFramework.GamePlay.Battle` — it is game logic, not engine-agnostic
  infrastructure. Still reachable via `Framework.GetModule<ISkillManager>()`/`<IBuffManager>()`.
- **GamePlay managers reachable via `Framework.GetModule<>()`.** All 19 singleton-manager GamePlay
  systems (Tweening, Abilities, AntiCheat, Atmosphere, Chat, CloudSave, Crafting, Experiments,
  Factions, Guide, Items, Matchmaking, Music, Netcode, Quest, TouchInput, Units, Worldmap, Activities)
  are now `FrameworkModule`s with `IXxx` interfaces — parity with core. Constructor dependencies became
  `SetXxx(...)` setter injection; backend-required ones (Chat/CloudSave/Matchmaking) use the
  helper-injection contract. Value/algorithm types stay POCO.
- **Enforced one-way layering** `Core ← GamePlay`: GamePlay references `EjoyFramework`; core and its
  Test/Unity/Editor satellites reference nothing in GamePlay. Battle tests moved to
  `EjoyFramework.GamePlay.Tests`, the Skill/Buff editor window to `EjoyFramework.GamePlay.Unity.Editor`.

### Added — Live-Ops & Platform modules (11)

- Time: server-anchored corrected clock (Unix-ms anchor + local monotonic delta), tamper-resistant
- Timer: centralized delay / repeat / end-of-frame scheduling driven by framework Update
- Http: HTTP manager (BaseUrl + default headers + retry) over an injectable `IHttpClient`
- RemoteConfig: typed remote-config values with local defaults + injectable provider
- Purchase: IAP purchase flow + product catalog + optional server-side receipt validation
- Notification: local + remote push scheduling over an injectable platform
- Analytics: unified event/property funnel over an injectable `IAnalyticsBackend`
- Diagnostics: crash reporting + log sinks / remote logging
- RedDot: red-dot (message-badge) tree with parent propagation
- Performance: FPS/memory sampling surfaced in the Debugger profiler tab
- Serialization: `ByteBuffer` + binary/deep-copy contracts (impls generated by Editor codegen)

### Added — GamePlay layer (`EjoyFramework.GamePlay`, 31 systems)

- New engine-agnostic gameplay layer (`Runtime/EjoyFramework.GamePlay/`) with 31 cross-genre
  systems plus a shared `Core` (GameMath) directory: Abilities, Activities, AntiCheat,
  Atmosphere, Attributes, Battle, Chat, CloudSave, Crafting, Dialogue, Experiments, Factions,
  Guide, Items, Leaderboard, Loot, Mail, Matchmaking, Music, Netcode, Pathfinding, Production,
  Quest, Sequencing, Social, Targeting, Tech, TouchInput, Tweening, Units, Worldmap
- Unity adapters (`Runtime/EjoyFramework.GamePlay.Unity/`) for 7 systems: Abilities, Music,
  Netcode, TouchInput, Tweening, Units, Worldmap
- `EjoyFramework.GamePlay.Tests` EditMode assembly covering the gameplay systems

### Changed

- Test totals recomputed from the source tree (see Tests below)

## [1.0.0] - 2026-05-18

  Entity / UI / Sound / Scene / Config / Localization / DataTable / DataNode /
  Setting / Network / Debugger
- AssetBundle pipeline with manifest, ref counting, dependency resolution,
  concurrent request coalescing
- IAssetLoadHandle state machine for cancellable loads
- BaseComponent drives `Framework.Update` from MonoBehaviour

  (sliding window), IntegrityCheck (CRC32 IEEE)

### Tests

Current counts (recomputed from the source tree):

- `EjoyFramework.Tests` (core EditMode): 549 — 536 `[Test]` + 13 `[TestCase]`
- `EjoyFramework.GamePlay.Tests` (EditMode): 1253 — 1230 `[Test]` + 23 `[TestCase]`
